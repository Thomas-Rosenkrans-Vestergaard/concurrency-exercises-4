Do you get the right result?
    I do not get the right result.
What is the problem in the code?
    The result is not correct since TurnstileCounter.incr() is not thread safe.
Solve the problem using synchronization techniques.
    Marking TurnstileCounter.incr() synchronized is an easy fix, only allowing one thread to execute the method at one
    time.
    Another fix is to manually maintain a lock.
